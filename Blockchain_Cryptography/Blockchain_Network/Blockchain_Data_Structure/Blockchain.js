/**
 * Blockchain Time
We have a new file: Blockchain.js. How exciting! 

This stage is going to focus on adding the first block to our new Blockchain class! The first block is often referred to as the Genesis Block.

Genesis Block
The genesis block is the first block in the chain, where it all kicks off! Every block after the genesis block links back to the first one, but the genesis block has no previous block! This is important to keep in mind for the next few stages. 

Here are some examples of genesis blocks on live blockchains displayed in their respective block explorers:

Bitcoin Genesis Block
Here's Bitcoin's Genesis Block on Block Explorer on January 3rd, 2009. https://blockstream.info/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f

Ethereum Genesis Block
Here's Ethereum's Genesis Block on EtherScan on July 30th, 2015. https://etherscan.io/block/0

 Your Goal: Add the Genesis Block
The Blockchain.js file contains the Blockchain class with a chain array. Let's add the Genesis Block to this array.

Create a new Block in the Blockchain constructor then add it to the chain array.
